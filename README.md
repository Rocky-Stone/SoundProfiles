-Profiles are saved in: /config/sound-profiles_profiles/"sound_profile_name".

-There are four profiles currently: normal, quiet, full, and custom.

-They are all technically custom, so use them however.

-I am a big noob when it comes to programming and especially minecraft modding, so go easy on me plz, lol.
If anyone has any suggestions for how to better save and edit the profiles, I am all ears.

-I probably won't be backporting this mod, but it is a very simple mod, so feel free to do so yourself if you have the knowhow.
Updates are not at all guarenteed.
